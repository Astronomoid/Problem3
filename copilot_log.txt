Steps taken in the project:

1. Initialized Git repository using 'git init'
2. Created a 'plot' directory for storing plot-related files
3. Created this copilot_log.txt file to track our progress
4. Created generate_coordinates.py script to generate 500 random astronomical coordinates
5. Generated coordinates.csv file with RA (0-360°) and Dec (-90° to +90°) values
6. Created README.md with project documentation and structure
7. Added coordinate conversion functionality using astropy to convert RA/Dec to Galactic and Ecliptic coordinates
8. Created coordinates_plot.py script to visualize the coordinate systems (Equatorial, Galactic, and Ecliptic)
9. Reorganized project structure:
   - Created code/ directory for Python scripts
   - Moved generate_coordinates.py and coordinates_plot.py to code/
   - Updated file paths to handle new directory structure
10. Set up Git repository:
    - Created .gitignore file
    - Added and committed all files
    - Configured Git user information
11. Enhanced visualization aesthetics:
    - Added custom color schemes for each coordinate system
    - Improved plot styling with dark background theme
    - Added better titles and labels
    - Customized grid appearance
    - Added metadata text
12. Created session_log.md documenting the entire project development process
